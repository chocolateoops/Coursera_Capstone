    "**New York City**, the most populous city in the United States, one of the greatest metropolises over the world, is a dream place for gourmet to seek delicious cuisine. Its food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (or delis) to the city. Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami and corned beef, respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to \"nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world,\" according to Michelin. As of 2019, there were 27,043 restaurants in the city, up from 24,865 in 2017[1]."

    "In this project we will try to find an optimal location for a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Chinese restaurant** in **New York City**.Since there are lots of restaurants in New York City we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Chinese restaurant in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met."
